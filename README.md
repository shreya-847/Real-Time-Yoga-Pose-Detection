# Real-Time-Yoga-Pose-Detection
Utilizes TensorFlow, Keras, and MediaPipe Pose for real-time recognition of yoga poses via a custom deep neural network integrated with webcam feeds. 

### Requirements:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- MediaPipe
- TensorFlow/Keras

The `yoga.py` script includes the complete implementation of the yoga pose detection model.
